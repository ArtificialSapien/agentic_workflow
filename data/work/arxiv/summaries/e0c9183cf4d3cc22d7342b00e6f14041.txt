Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information. A growing range of disciplines are involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking. It models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation.
