## **Getting Started**

### **Start the Backend**
1. Ensure you are in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd agentic-workflow
   ```

2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. Open the API documentation in your browser:
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

---

### **Start the Frontend**
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the application in your browser:
   [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
